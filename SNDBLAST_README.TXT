Updated SNDBLAST.DRV & MTBLAST.DRV

This updated SNDBLAST.DRV will play stereo Adlib music (with slightly increased polyphony than the original mono only ADL.DRV driver) and digital sound effects (ship flyby and Roger saying "Where am I?" in Space Quest 3 intro). Works with all SCI0 and possibly SCI01 games.
